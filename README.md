> ### You can always count on me when...

> ### A funny story 
>
> First, you need to know I am litteraly afraid of almost **everything**, especially holes, of any kind, and water. I can't explain why I fear water, but it scares me so much to feel it on my face that I often hit the walls of my shower when trying to be an hygienic person no mather what comes into my way.
>
> Anyway, when me and my husband were dating, we went to France joining two friends of him on a trip. The group wanted to go canoeing down through the Ardèche river gorges, and I of course didn't want them to think I'm a coward so I followed.
>
> Supriselingly, it went great at first. We were canoeing by groups of two, my future husband was doing a terrific job at reassuring me, and we quickly took the lead of the queue. We were going faster and faster and soon, we saw no other canoes around us, only our friends behind us.The path was getting weird and after some strange turns we felt into furious rapids, suddenly surrounded by treathning spiky rocks.
>
> I can't tell you how we managed not to fall into water fighting with the rapids, only relying on basic primal instincts (yes, I have some, who would have thought).
>
>  After getting our heads straight, we met a fisherman who laughed at us, told us we missed the end point, and gave us a little inch on what was coming next: big deadly waterfalls and, in case of survival, drawning into the sea or lethal collision with a big ship. So we stopped, obviously. Lucky us.
>
> We spend the end of the evening drinking a bier with the man and his brother, waiting for the angry canoe rental people to come and get us. 
>
> 
>
> ##### TL;DR
>
> *I almost die doing kayak because I missed the end point .*
